# CS 320 Portfolio – Module 8 Journal

## Project One – Contact Service
This project contains my implementation of the Contact Service in Java, including:
- `Contact.java`
- `ContactService.java`
- `ContactTest.java`
- `ContactServiceTest.java`

The service manages contact objects with unique IDs, names, phone numbers, and addresses.  
JUnit tests verify that all requirements are met and that the service behaves correctly when adding, updating, or deleting contacts.

## Project Two – Summary and Reflection
I also included my Project Two reflection file (`CS320_Module7-2.docx`).  
This reflection describes how software testing improves efficiency, the pros and cons of automation,  
and my experience creating JUnit tests for Contact, Task, and Appointment services.

## How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I make sure my code is functional by using automated unit tests to check that every method works as expected.  
I also use input validation to stop bad data from getting into the program.  
For security, I avoid storing sensitive data in plain text and follow safe coding practices  
like checking for null values and handling exceptions.

## How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I start by reading the requirements carefully to understand what the user wants.  
Then I break them down into smaller tasks that can be coded and tested one by one.  
I keep the design simple so it’s easier to update later if the user’s needs change.

## How do I approach designing software?
I use a step-by-step process:  
1. Understand the requirements.  
2. Plan the classes, methods, and tests.  
3. Write the code in small sections.  
4. Test each section before moving on.  
5. Review and improve the code to make it cleaner and easier to maintain.
